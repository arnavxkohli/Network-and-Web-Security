# Lab 3 Questions

## Imagine that an attacker were able to use kali-vm. What kind of network attacker would they be? (Refer back to the slides for Module 7 and think about the capabilities the attacker would have on the dirtylan network, based on what youâ€™ve just seen in Wireshark.)

Since kali-vm is able to act as a DHCP client and provide an IP address to listener, this allows kali-vm to act as a Man In The Middle attacker. This meansI will be able to intercept network traffic.
